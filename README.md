# 👋 Hi, I'm Parsa

I’m an engineer with a strong interest in **automation, infrastructure, and modern DevOps practices**.  
My focus is on learning how systems are built, deployed, secured, and automated — not just how to write code.

Right now, I’m deliberately moving deeper into the **automation side of engineering**:
CI/CD, containers, cloud infrastructure, and reproducible environments.

---

## 🔧 What I’m Learning & Building Around

I’m actively developing hands-on skills in:

- **CI/CD & Automation**
  - Jenkins pipelines
  - Automated testing & deployment workflows
  - Git-based release processes

- **Containers & Orchestration**
  - Docker (images, networking, volumes)
  - Kubernetes (pods, services, deployments, basic Helm usage)
  - Understanding how production workloads actually fail

- **Cloud Platforms**
  - AWS & Azure fundamentals
  - Compute, networking, storage, IAM concepts
  - Cost-aware and security-aware design

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
  - Terraform for reproducible infrastructure
  - Environment separation (dev / staging / prod)
  - Declarative vs imperative infrastructure thinking

- **Linux & Systems**
  - Linux internals, services, networking
  - Debugging from logs instead of guesswork
  - Automation with Bash, Python, and Go

## 🧠 How I Think About Engineering

- Automation beats heroics  
- Repeatability beats manual fixes  
- Understanding *why systems break* matters more than shiny tools  
- Security, networking, and infrastructure are not “someone else’s job”

I’m intentionally building depth before chasing titles.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Current & Growing)

- **Languages:** Python, Go, Bash  
- **Containers:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes  
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins  
- **IaC:** Terraform  
- **Cloud:** AWS, Azure  
- **OS:** Linux  
- **Security:** OWASP, CEH fundamentals

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub is a **learning log** and **sandbox**:
- Automation experiments
- CI/CD pipeline examples
- Containerized services
- Infrastructure-as-Code practice
- Notes turned into runnable code

Expect iteration, not perfection.

*Still learning. Still breaking things. Still automating them properly afterward.*
